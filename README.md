# Python Packet Sniffer & Analyzer

A simple **cybersecurity project** built in Python that can capture, analyze, and display details of network packets.  
This project demonstrates **network traffic monitoring, packet inspection, and protocol analysis** using Python libraries.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Capture live network packets (Linux/macOS) or read from `.pcap` files (cross-platform).
- Analyze Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers.
- Save captured packets to log files for later use.
- Detect unusual traffic patterns (e.g., suspicious ports, frequent packets).
- Beginner-friendly implementation with **step-by-step code**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- `scapy` (for packet parsing & offline capture)
- `socket` (for raw packet capture – Linux/macOS only)
